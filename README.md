2) Population Density, v4 data for 2015 from here http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density/data-download
  - gpw-v4-population-density_2015.tif
3) World shape file from here http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-national-identifier-grid/data-download
Put all these files into the same folder with the code and you should be good to go.
